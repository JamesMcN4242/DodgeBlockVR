# DodgeBlockVR
An evening project aimed at re-familiarising myself with the basics of Unity's XR package and also the SteamVR plugin when developing for virtual reality applications.
The plan is currently aimed at making a simplistic rythm-like game based on dodging blocks flying towards you. 
The project is being kept small in scope with a self imposed week long deadline being set. (04/07/2021 - 09/07/2021) This is primarily aimed to be kept so condensed to allow me to move onto some other planned personal projects that will tie back into this repo at a later date. 

##Development Log

###Day One (04/07/2021)
Day one of the project has been a simplistic setup to the premiss of the game, alongside the import of both the SteamVR plugin and Unity's own XR package.
Unity's own XR package was created in the time since I last used the SteamVR plugin, so I'm currently unsure if both are required for new projects. Some reading is required tomorrow to find out and strip out any unnecessary files.

The three hours of development today has seen blocks fly at the user and from scene defineable placements. Varying speeds can be applied to the blocks and collisions between them and the player are tracked and processed. Debug logs are the only messaging used at current to determine a player's score (debug set) and inform player's when they've lost.
